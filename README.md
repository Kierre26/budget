Budget Tracker

With this application you are able to login or register for each user. After logging in you will be directed to the dashboard where you can add new transactions, add new budgets, and view a summary chart displaying overall incomes vs expenses. If you click on either of the blue buttons you’ll be redirected to either a transaction or budget form to add. From the home page you are also able to edit and delete existing transactions or budgets by using the pencil or trash buttons. In the navbar you’ll also be able to go to either transaction or budget pages where you can see a focused list. There is also a logout button if needed.  

Any budgets will calculate the remaining amount from the limit if an expense happens within the budgets date range.
